A polyfill is a shim for a browser API. It typically checks if a browser supports an API. If it doesnâ€™t, the polyfill installs its own implementation. That allows you to use the API in either case. The term polyfill comes from a home improvement product; according to Remy Sharp:

"Polyfilla is a UK product known as Spackling Paste in the US. With that in mind: think of the browsers as a wall with cracks in it. These [polyfills] help smooth out the cracks and give us a nice smooth wall of browsers to work with."
